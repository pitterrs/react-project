## Usage

### 1. Install from Artifactory
```bash
npm install @deere/fuel-tokens
```
### 2. Import into App
For web applications, tokens can be imported into an application via SASS variables, [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*), or JS variables.

##### SASS Variables
Import the SASS variables wherever you import other SCSS partials. All of the tokens are prefixed to avoid conflicts with existing variables. 
```scss
@import '~@deere/fuel-tokens/build/web/jd-green/tokens';
```

##### CSS Custom Properties (CSS variables)
Import the CSS variables wherever you are importing other global CSS. 
###### SCSS Import
```scss
@import '~@deere/fuel-tokens/build/web/jd-green/tokens.css';
```
###### JS Import
```jsx
import '@deere/fuel-tokens/build/web/jd-green/tokens.css';
```

##### JS Variables
Import the JS Variables on an as-needed basis within your project.
```jsx
import { FuelColorJdYellow } from '@deere/fuel-tokens/build/web/jd-green/tokens';
```

### 3. Using Tokens in App
We've found that there are use cases for all three ways the Fuel Tokens can be consumed on the web. The SASS variables are great if your application is already using SCSS and you want to leverage your existing setup and mixins/functions. The CSS Variables can be utilized to create themes that can be swapped out with ease. The JS Variables can be used for inline styling or if you are using a CSS-in-JS architecture. 

##### SASS Variables
```scss
.example-product-item {
  color: $fuel-color-text-body;
  background-color: $fuel-color-background-gray;
  padding: $fuel-spacing-6;
}
```

##### CSS Variables
```scss
.example-product-item-link {
  color: var(--fuel-color-brand-primary);
  font-size: var(--fuel-font-size-sm);
  padding: var(--fuel-spacing-2);
}
```

##### JS Variables
```jsx
const chevronIconStyle = {
    primary: {
        fill: FuelColorJdYellow
    }
};
```

### Using Theme Specific Tokens
You can easily toggle between themes by using the theme specific CSS custom property files.

```bash
import '@deere/fuel-tokens/build/web/jd-black/fuel-theme-jd-black.css';
import '@deere/fuel-tokens/build/web/jd-green/fuel-theme-jd-green.css';
```

##### Theming Applied with Class
```html
<html class="fuel-theme-jd-black" lang="en">
  ...
</html>
```

##### Theming Applied with Data Attribute
```html
<html data-theme="fuel-jd-black" lang="en">
  ...
</html>
```

## Background on Design Tokens
If you are familiar with [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), design tokens are the atomic or subatomic elements that are used to compose our components. They are the foundational elements that allow for consistency across different platforms and technologies. In abstracting these from a single output language, we are able to enable design, web, iOS, and Android to speak a common language. We use Style Dictionary to achieve this as it automates the building out of these key values.

###### Consistency Through Scales
Instead of allowing every option, scales help us to better categorize available options and communicate with a common language.
