# UXFrame React 2019.5.0

The UXFrame React component library gives developers across the enterprise easy access to reusable components that adhere to the **FUEL Design System** guidelines. The goal of this library is to streamline the development process and help increase consistency of design, markup, and behavior across applications. Accessibility is core to these components and we are constantly looking for ways to ensure our component library is as inclusive as possible.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

`npm i @deere/ux.uxframe-react`

Use NPM to install the latest version of UXFrame React components. If you are running into a 404 error when attempting to download the package, make sure your Artifactory is set up correctly. The [Javascript Onboarding](https://github.deere.com/javascript/onboarding/#setup-npmrc) docs will walk you through the process.

Your `.npmrc` file should look something like this:

```
registry=https://npm.deere.com/
email = youremail@email.com
```

### 2. Include Styling

Make sure to include the CSS in your project. You can choose to include the whole file as shown below or you can import specific SCSS files into your components. We are currently exploring options to make importing CSS easier via CSS Modules or Styled Components.

`import '@deere/ux.uxframe-core/dist/css/uxframe.min.css';`

### 3. Import the Component

We use named import conventions in this library so it is only necessary to import the root of the project and include the components you want in the import.

`import { Button, Header, ChartsGraphs } from '@deere/ux.uxframe-react';`

**Note:** A majority of the components are simply wrappers around the [React Bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) library. We have included a README with all of our components. If it is not a custom UXFrame component, we have simply pointed you to the React Bootstrap documentation for that component.

## Storybook

All of our components have a [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) example. If you have cloned this repository directly from GitHub, you can build the storybook locally on your machine.

`yarn run storybook`

Or you can view our [UXFrame React Storybook](http://ux.deere.com/uxframe-react).

## Methodology

We want to make sure our components are easy to use, follow best practices, and developed collaboratively.

1. **Easy to Use**
    - If you cannot easily implement our components into your application, don't hesitate to reach out to us or submit an issue.
2. **Follows Best Practices**
    - Our code should utilize best practices for Javascript and React development.
    - Semantic HTML
    - [Accessible](http://ux.deere.com/resources/accessibility/) (WCAG 2.0 AA)
3. **Collaborative**
    - We won't be able to create the best product possible by ourselves. We need the help of the Deere community to build these components alongside us.

#### Inclusive

For us, inclusion means our users can easily access and understand the components we create by adhering to coding and accessibility standards. We also strive to reduce the barriers in development in the hope of including as many developers as we can in the process. Our goal is that not only will teams across Deere make use of this library but also actively contribute to it. If you don't feel we are adhering to these principles, please [open an issue](https://github.deere.com/ux/uxframe/issues) and let us know how we can improve. The nature of trying to provide an inclusive experience is that it is nearly impossible without the help of our community.

## Learning Resources

If you are new to React and looking to get a good foundation, we recommend starting with the official [React.js Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html). From there, you can find a sample project to start building and begin to understand how the smaller pieces work together. The [Awesome React](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react) repository has a very long list of React resources.

If you are new to Javascript development in general, it is a good idea to go through the fundamentals of Javascript before you begin working with React. A good primer on JS is [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke.

Another great resource for vanilla Javascript is [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](http://javascript.info/)

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome and encouraged. Soon, we'll have contribution guidelines documenting how we expect changes to be made.
